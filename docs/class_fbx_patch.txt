Class Description

   A patch is a type of node attribute with parametric surface.

   A patch object is useful for creating gently curved surfaces, and provides very detailed control for manipulating complex geometry.

   Examples:
          ExportScene01/main.cxx, and ImportScene/DisplayPatch.cxx.
