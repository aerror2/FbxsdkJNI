Class Description

   Mutually excluding thread lock mechanism.

   While the mutex is a much heavier implementation than a spinlock, it supports recursive locking; the same thread can safely lock the same mutex more than once without blocking. But it will have to be released as many times as it as been acquired before other threads can acquire the context. It is sometimes referred as a critical section. This is the heaviest thread lock implementation, but also the most secure.

   void Acquire ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Acquire the lock; thread will wait indefinitely until it is available.

   Remarks:
          The same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without blocking.

   bool TryAcquire ( unsigned int  pRetryCount )
   Search for all occurrences

   Try acquiring the lock; thread will not wait if it is not available.

   Parameters:

          pRetryCount The number of retries in case the lock is not available.

   Returns:
          True if the lock is acquired, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          The same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without blocking.

   void Release ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Release the lock; this will allow other threads to acquire the lock if they are waiting.

   Remarks:
          Only the owner thread should call Release(), and it needs to be released as many times as it was acquired.
