Class Description

   This class is an composite of animation curves and is called as animation curve node.

   Animation curve node is used as the connection point for animation curves and other animation curve nodes associated to a property. FbxAnimCurveNode can be connected to other FbxAnimCurveNode, in this case, the destination animation curve node may be considered as "composite", IsComposite(). remarks When created, the FbxAnimCurveNode has no valid channels unless it is created using the function CreateTypedCurveNode(). This function will add all the required channels to correctly match the number of
   values of the property. For instance, when CreateTypedCurveNode(pNode.LclTranslation, pScene) is called, the resulting FbxAnimCurveNode will automatically have 3 channels corresponding to the X,Y and Z components of the LclTranslation property. You can add and remove channels dynamically but can never remove the channels that have been added by the call to CreateTypedCurveNode().

   However, the FBX SDK animation system's default implementation is to consider only the first curve connected to the channel. Therefore, if the caller connects multiple animation curves to the same channel, then it becomes the caller's responsibility to handle and manipulate these extra curves in a meaningful manner.

   Examples:
          Animation/main.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayAnimation.cxx, Instances/main.cxx, UI_Examples/CubeCreator/SDK_Utility.cxx, and UserProperties/main.cxx.

Member Function Documentation

   bool IsAnimated ( bool  pRecurse = false ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Check if the animation curve node contains any animation key.

   Parameters:

          pRecurse true to descend to the children if the animation curve node is composite.

   Returns:
          true if at least one animation curve that contains one or more animation keys is found, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          This method only considers the first animation curve connected to each channel. To check multiple animation curves that are connected to the same channel, it is the caller's responsibility to write a new version of this method, and GetCurveCount() will be useful in this case.

   bool GetAnimationInterval ( FbxTimeSpan &  pTimeInterval ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Find out start and end time of the animation.

   This function retrieves the including time span for all animation curves of this animation curve node.

   Parameters:

          pTimeInterval Reference to receive start time and end time.

   Returns:
          true on success, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          false is also returned if this animation curve node has no animation.
          This method only considers the first animation curve connected to each channel. To find time interval of multiple animation curves that are connected to the same channel, it is the caller's responsibility to write a new version of this method, and GetCurveCount() will be useful in this case.

   bool IsComposite ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Test this object to see if it is a composite FbxAnimCurveNode or a "leaf".

   A composite FbxAnimCurveNode is a FbxAnimCurveNode whose all source connections are FbxAnimCurveNode and its property channels is totally empty. It is just a container to take other FbxAnimCurveNode.

   Returns:
          true if this object is a composite, false otherwise.

   FbxAnimCurveNode* Find ( const char *  pName )
   Search for all occurrences

   Recursively look for the FbxAnimCurveNode matching the passed named argument.

   Parameters:

          pName Name of the FbxAnimCurveNode we are looking for.

   Returns:
          The found anim curve node or NULL.

   Remarks:
          If pName is an empty string, this function automatically return NULL.

   static FbxAnimCurveNode* CreateTypedCurveNode ( FbxProperty &  pProperty,
                                                   FbxScene *     pScene
                                                 )                [static]
   Search for all occurrences

   Create a FbxAnimCurveNode compatible with the specified property data type.

   Parameters:

          pProperty The property that needs a FbxAnimCurveNode.
          pScene    The scene the created FbxAnimCurveNode will belong to.

   Returns:
          The pointer to the newly created FbxAnimCurveNode. Returns NULL if an error occurred.

   Remarks:
          This function does not connect the newly created FbxAnimCurveNode to the property.
          This function detects FbxDouble3, FbxDouble4 and FbxDouble4x4 properties DataTypes and automatically adds the required channels properties. Any other DataType is not specifically processed and the channels properties are left empty and need to be filled using the AddChannel() function.

   Examples:
          Animation/main.cxx.

   unsigned int GetChannelsCount ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the total number of property channels defined in this animation curve node.

   For composite animation curve nodes, since they do not contain any channels, this function will always return 0.

   Returns:
          The number of property channels.

   Examples:
          Animation/main.cxx.

   int GetChannelIndex ( const char *  pChannelName ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the index of the named channel.

   Parameters:

          pChannelName Name of the channel for which we want the index.

   Search for all occurrences

   Get the name of the channel.

   Parameters:

          pChannelId Index of the channel for which we want the name.

   void ResetChannels ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Empties the property channels of this animation curve node.

   Remarks:
          This function will remove all the channels added with the AddChannel() method regardless of their use and/or connections. But it can not remove the channels that are added by the call to CreateTypedCurveNode().

   Examples:
          Animation/main.cxx.

   bool AddChannel ( const char *  pChnlName,
                     T const &     pValue
                   )               [inline]

   Adds the specified channel property.

   Parameters:

          pChnlName Channel name.
          pValue    Default value of the channel.
