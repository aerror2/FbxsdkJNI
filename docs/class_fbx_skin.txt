Class Description

   Skin deformer class.

   A skin deformer contains clusters (FbxCluster). Each cluster acts on a subset of the geometry's control points, with different weights. For example, a mesh of humanoid shape can have a skin attached, that describes the way the humanoid mesh is deformed by bones. When the bones are animated, the clusters act on the geometry to animate it too.

   The corresponding deformer types are FbxDeformer::eSkin.

   Examples:
          ExportScene01/main.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayLink.cxx, SwitchBinding/main.cxx, and ViewScene/DrawScene.cxx.

Control Points

   A skin has an array of indices to control points and associated blend weights.

   The indices refer to the control points in the instance of class FbxGeometry. The blend weights are the influence of the different skinning type over the deformation effect of the indexed control points.
                 void  AddControlPointIndex (int pIndex, double pBlendWeight=0)
                       Add an element in both arrays of control point indices and blendWeights.

   Skinning type.

   The skinning type decides which method will be used to do the skinning.
     * eRigid Type eRigid means rigid skinning, which means only one joint can influence each control point.
     * eLinear Type eLinear means the classic linear smooth skinning.
     * eDualQuaternion Type eDualQuaternion means the dual quaternion smooth skinning.
     * eBlend Type eBlend means to blend classic linear and dual quaternion smooth skinning according to blend weights.
