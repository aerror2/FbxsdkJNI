Class Description

   Unroll filter.

   Filter to apply continuous rotation values to animation curves. Due to Euler rotation properties, when a rotation angle cross over the 180 degree value, it becomes -179. This filter tries to keep a continuous rotation effectively by producing increasing values, to actually become 181 degrees, etc...

   Remarks:
          The current implementation of this filter expects to process 3 curves at the same time.
          By default, this filter does not affect the tangent values of the modified keys. This means that, for CUBIC interpolation curves containing keys with USER or BREAK tangents, the unrolled curves will correctly match the original rotation exactly on the curve keys but not in-between them. The filter can be configured to automatically convert the USER and BREAK tangents to AUTO tangents by setting the ForceAutoTangents flag. Using the AUTO tangents mode can result in a more consistent
          interpolation between the curve keys.

   This filter expects to work with 3 interdependent curves.

   Passing the animation stack makes no sense since this object would not know which curves to handle.

   Parameters:

          pAnimStack Animation stack
          pStatus    The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   Returns:

   This filter expects to work with 3 interdependent curves.

   Collecting all the animation curves from the properties defined in pObj could not guarantee that we are manipulating 3 interdependent curves.

   Parameters:

          pObj       Object containing the properties to test.
          pAnimStack Animation stack where to retrieve the animation curves
          pStatus    The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   Returns:
          false.

   Search for all occurrences

   Check if the animation curve node needs an application of the filter.

   Parameters:

          pCurveNode Curve node to test.
          pStatus    The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   Returns:
          true if the animation curve node needs an application of the filter, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          This method checks that the pCurveNode is representing an Euler rotation. It will validate that 3 animation curves are defined. If the condition is not met, the method will return false.

   Reimplemented from FbxAnimCurveFilter.
   virtual bool NeedApply ( FbxAnimCurve **  pCurve,
                            int              pCount,

                          )                  [virtual]
   Search for all occurrences

   Check if the given animation curve needs an application of the filter.

   Parameters:

          pCurve  Array of curves to test if they need an application of the filter.
          pCount  Number of curves in array.
          pStatus The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   Returns:
          true if at least one animation curve in the array needs an application of the filter, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          Because this method only receives an array of interdependent curves, this filter assumes that they are all coming from an Euler rotation anim curve node. Therefore, it expects pCount to be equal to 3.

   Reimplemented from FbxAnimCurveFilter.

                            FbxStatus *     pStatus = NULL

   double GetQualityTolerance ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the unroll quality tolerance.

   Returns:
          The current unroll quality tolerance.

   Remarks:
          This value is only used when SetTestForPath() is set to true.

   void SetQualityTolerance ( double  pQualityTolerance )
   Search for all occurrences

   Set the unroll quality tolerance.

   Parameters:

          pQualityTolerance The unroll quality tolerance to set.

   Remarks:
          This value is only used when SetTestForPath() is set to true.

   bool GetTestForPath ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get if the test path is enabled.

   Returns:
          true if test for path is enabled.

   Remarks:
          The unroll filter takes a key as a reference key and updates the following keys accordingly to try to keep the continuity between this reference key and its following keys. If the test path is enabled, the filter can use the same key as reference key to update the following keys until the difference of continuity between the newly updated key and the reference key exceeds the quality tolerance, then the reference key will be updated as the newly updated key. If the test path is not enabled,
          the filter will always use the newly updated key as reference to update the next key. The quality tolerance can be set and queried by SetQualityTolerance() and GetQualityTolerance().

   void SetTestForPath ( bool  pTestForPath )
   Search for all occurrences

   Set if the test path is enabled.

   Parameters:

          pTestForPath Value to set if test for path is to be enabled.

   Remarks:
          The unroll filter takes a key as a reference key and updates the following keys accordingly to try to keep the continuity between this reference key and its following keys. If the test path is enabled, the filter can use the same key as reference key to update the following keys until the difference of continuity between the newly updated key and the reference key exceeds the quality tolerance, then the reference key will be updated as the newly updated key. If the test path is not enabled,
          the filter will always use the newly updated key as reference to update the next key. The quality tolerance can be set and queried by SetQualityTolerance() and GetQualityTolerance().

   bool GetForceAutoTangents ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the current state of the ForceAutoTangents flag.

   Returns:
          true if forcing AUTO tangents is enabled.

   Remarks:
          This flag is considered only on curves using the CUBIC interpolation and keys with the USER or BREAK tangents. For any other type of interpolations or tangents, this flag is ignored.

   void SetForceAutoTangents ( bool  pForceAutoTangents )
   Search for all occurrences

   Set the new state of the ForceAutoTangents flag.

   Parameters:

          pForceAutoTangents New value of the flag.

   Remarks:
          This flag is considered only on curves using the CUBIC interpolation and keys with the USER or BREAK tangents. For any other type of interpolations or tangents, this flag is ignored.
