Class Description

   This class contains the description of a Pose and provide some methods to access Pose info in one FBX scene.

   The FbxPose object can be setup to hold "Bind Pose" data or "Rest Pose" data.

   The Bind Pose holds the transformation (translation, rotation and scaling) matrix of all the nodes implied in a link deformation. This includes the geometry being deformed, the links deforming the geometry, and recursively all the ancestors nodes of the link. The Bind Pose gives you the transformation of the nodes at the moment of the binding operation when no deformation occurs.

   The Rest Pose is a snapshot of a node transformation. A Rest Pose can be used to store the position of every node of a character at a certain point in time. This pose can then be used as a reference position for animation tasks, like editing walk cycles.

   One difference between the two modes is in the validation performed before adding an item and the kind of matrix stored.

   In "Bind Pose" mode, the matrix is assumed to be defined in the global space, while in "Rest Pose" the type of the matrix may be specified by the caller. So local system matrices can be used. Actually, because there is one such flag for each entry (FbxPoseInfo), it is possible to have mixed types in a FbxPose elements. It is therefore the responsibility of the caller to check for the type of the retrieved matrix and to do the appropriate conversions if required.

   The validation of the data to be added consists of the following steps:
     * If this FbxPose object stores "Bind Poses", then add a FbxPoseInfo only if the node is not already associated to another "Bind Pose". This check is done by visiting ALL the FbxPose objects in the system.

   The above test is only performed for the "Bind Pose" type. While the next one is always performed, no matter what kind of poses this FbxPose object is setup to hold.
     * If a node is already inserted in the FbxPose internal list, then the passed matrix MUST be equal to the one already stored. If this is not the case, the Add method will return -1, indicating that no new FbxPoseInfo has been created.

   If the Add method succeeds, it will return the index of the FbxPoseInfo structure that as been created and held by the FbxPose object.

   To ensure data integrity, the stored information can only be accessed using the provided methods (read-only). If an entry needs to be modified, the caller has to remove the FbxPoseInfo item by calling Remove(i) and then Add a new one.

   The internal list is not ordered and the search inside this list is linear (from the first element to ... the first match or the end of the list).

   Examples:
          ExportScene01/main.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayPose.cxx, SwitchBinding/main.cxx, ViewScene/DrawScene.cxx, ViewScene/DrawScene.h, ViewScene/GetPosition.cxx, ViewScene/GetPosition.h, and ViewScene/SceneContext.cxx.

          true if all the above conditions are met and false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          If the returned value is false, querying for the error will return the reason of the failure. As soon as one of the above conditions is not met, this method return ignoring any subsequent errors. Run the IsBindPoseVerbose if more details are needed.

   bool IsValidBindPoseVerbose ( FbxNode *    pRoot,
                                 NodeList &   pMissingAncestors,
                                 NodeList &   pMissingDeformers,
                                 NodeList &   pMissingDeformersAncestors,
                                 NodeList &   pWrongMatrices,
                                 double       pMatrixCmpTolerance = 0.0001,
                                 FbxStatus *  pStatus = NULL
                               )
   Search for all occurrences

   Same as IsValidBindPose() but slower because it will not stop as soon as a failure occurs.

   Instead, keeps running to accumulate the faulty nodes (stored in the appropriate array). It is then up to the caller to fill the UserNotification if desired.

   Parameters:

          pRoot                      This node is used as the stop point when visiting the parents (cannot be NULL).
          pMissingAncestors          Each ancestor missing from the BindPose is added to this list.
          pMissingDeformers          Each deformer missing from the BindPose is added to this list.
          pMissingDeformersAncestors Each deformer ancestors missing from the BindPose is added to this list.
          pWrongMatrices             Nodes that yield to a wrong matrix comparisons are added to this list.
          pMatrixCmpTolerance        Tolerance value when comparing the matrices.
          pStatus                    The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   bool IsValidBindPoseVerbose ( FbxNode *              pRoot,
                                 FbxUserNotification *  pUserNotification,
                                 double                 pMatrixCmpTolerance = 0.0001,
                                 FbxStatus *            pStatus = NULL
                               )
   Search for all occurrences

   Same as IsValidBindPose() but slower because it will not stop as soon as a failure occurs.

   Instead, keeps running to accumulate the faulty nodes and send them directly to the UserNotification.

   Parameters:

          pRoot               This node is used as the stop point when visiting the parents (cannot be NULL).
          pUserNotification   Pointer to the user notification where the messages will be accumulated.
          pMatrixCmpTolerance Tolerance value when comparing the matrices.
          pStatus             The FbxStatus object to hold error codes.

   Remarks:
          If the pUserNotification parameter is NULL, this method will call IsValidBindPose().
