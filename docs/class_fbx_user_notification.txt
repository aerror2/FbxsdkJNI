Class Description

   This class accumulates user notifications and sends them to any device opened by the derived classes.

   If this class is not derived, the data can only be sent to a log file. To send data to a log file, it must be opened before attempting to send data, otherwise, the messages will be lost.

Constructor & Destructor Documentation

   FbxUserNotification ( FbxManager *       pManager,
                         FbxString const &  pLogFileName,
                         FbxString const &  pSessionDescription
                       )

   Instantiate a FbxUserNotification but leave it uninitialized.

   The caller must explicitly call InitAccumulator to initialize it and ClearAccumulator when finished using it.

   Parameters:

          pManager
          pLogFileName Name of the log file that will be open in the directory defined by the GetLogFilePath method.

   Remarks:
          If pLogFileName is an empty string the log file does not get created and any output sent to it is lost.

   Parameters:

          pSessionDescription This string is used to separate session logs in the file.

   Remarks:
          If the specified log file already exists, messages are appended to it. This class never deletes the log file. Derived classes may delete the log file before opening (it must be done in the constructor because the log file is opened in the InitAccumulator) or at the end of the processing in the PostTerminate method.

   virtual ~FbxUserNotification ( ) [virtual]

   Destructor.

   Create and initialize user notification object for the SDK manager.

   One SDK manager has one global user notification object. If the SDK manager already has global user notification object, the function will do nothing.

   Parameters:

          pManager
          pLogFileName        Name of the log file that will be open in the directory defined by the GetLogFilePath method.
          pSessionDescription This string is used to separate session logs in the file.

   Returns:
          the global user notification object owned by the SDK manager.

   static void Destroy ( FbxManager *  pManager ) [static]
   Search for all occurrences

   Destroy the global user notification object owned by the SDK manager.
   void InitAccumulator ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Accumulator is to hold the notification entries.

   User can add entries to it. This method must be called before using the Accumulator. It opens the log file and calls AccumulatorInit followed by OpenExtraDevices. Failing to call this method will prevent other actions except ClearAccumulator, GetLogFileName and GetLogFilePath.
   void ClearAccumulator ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   This method must be called when the Accumulator is no longer needed.

   It calls CloseExtraDevices, followed by the AccumulatorClear, and then closes the log file.
   int AddEntry ( const int                    pID,
                  const FbxString &            pName,
                  const FbxString &            pDescr,
                  FbxAccumulatorEntry::EClass  pClass = FbxAccumulatorEntry::eWarning
                )
   Search for all occurrences

   Adds one entry into the accumulator.

   Parameters:

          pID    This entry unique ID.
          pName  This entry name.
          pDescr The description of this entry.
          pClass The category of this entry.

   Returns:
          The ID of the newly allocated entry. This ID is pEntryId.

   int AddDetail ( int  pEntryId )
   Search for all occurrences

   Completes the accumulator entry (there can be more that one detail for each entry) and implicitly defines the sequence of events.

   Each call to this method is internally recorded, making it possible to output each notification in the order they have been defined. Also, when a detail is added to an entry, it is automatically unmuted so it can be sent to the devices (muted FbxAccumulatorEntry objects are not processed).

   Parameters:

          pEntryId The entry index (as returned by AddEntry).

   Returns:
          The id of the detail in the recorded sequence of events. This Id should be used when the call to Output has the eSequencedDetails set as a source. If an error occurs, the returned value is -1

   int AddDetail ( int        pEntryId,
                   FbxString  pString
                 )
   Search for all occurrences

   Completes the accumulator entry (there can be more that one detail for each entry) and implicitly defines the sequence of events.

   Each call to this method is internally recorded, making it possible to output each notification in the order they have been defined. Also, when a detail is added to an entry, it is automatically unmuted so it can be sent to the devices (muted FbxAccumulatorEntry objects are not processed).

   Parameters:

          pEntryId The entry index (as returned by AddEntry).
          pString  The detail string to add to the entry.

   Returns:
          The id of the detail in the recorded sequence of events. This Id should be used when the call to Output has the eSequencedDetails set as a source. If an error occurs, the returned value is -1

   int AddDetail ( int        pEntryId,
                   FbxNode *  pNode
                 )
   Search for all occurrences

   Completes the accumulator entry (there can be more that one detail for each entry) and implicitly defines the sequence of events.

   Each call to this method is internally recorded, making it possible to output each notification in the order they have been defined. Also, when a detail is added to an entry, it is automatically unmuted so it can be sent to the devices (muted FbxAccumulatorEntry objects are not processed).

   Parameters:

          pEntryId The entry index (as returned by AddEntry).
          pNode    The node to add to the entry.

   Returns:
          The id of the detail in the recorded sequence of events. This Id should be used when the call to Output has the eSequencedDetails set as a source. If an error occurs, the returned value is -1

   int GetNbEntries ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns the number of AccumulatorEntries currently stored in this accumulator.
   const FbxAccumulatorEntry* GetEntry ( int  pEntryId ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the specified FbxAccumulatorEntry.

   Parameters:

          pEntryId ID of the entry to retrieve.

   Returns:
          Pointer to the specified entry, otherwise NULL if either the id is invalid or the Accumulator is not properly initialized.

   const FbxAccumulatorEntry* GetEntryAt ( int  pEntryIndex ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the FbxAccumulatorEntry at the specified index.

   Parameters:

          pEntryIndex index of the entry to retrieve.

   Returns:
          Pointer to the specified entry, otherwise NULL if either the index is invalid or the Accumulator is not properly initialized..

   int GetNbDetails ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns the number of Details recorded so far in this accumulator.
   int GetDetail ( int                           pDetailId,
                   const FbxAccumulatorEntry *&  pAE
                 )                               const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the specified detail.

   Parameters:

          pDetailId Index of the detail. This is the id-th detail of type pClass as inserted when the AddDetail
          pAE       Pointer to the FbxAccumulatorEntry object that contains the requested detail. The returned valued can be NULL if an error occurred.

   Returns:
          The index of the detail to be used when calling the GetDetail of the FbxAccumulatorEntry.

   Remarks:
          A value of -1 is acceptable and means that the FbxAccumulatorEntry has no details. However, if pAE is NULL, the return value is meaningless.
