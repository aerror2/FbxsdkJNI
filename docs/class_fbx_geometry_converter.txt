Class Description

   This class provides the functionality to convert geometry nodes attributes (FbxMesh, FbxNurbs and FbxPatch) and mainly focuses on the two major categories: Triangulation and conversion between NURBS and Patches surfaces.

   Examples:
          Normals/main.cxx, and ViewScene/SceneContext.cxx.

                    )
   Search for all occurrences

   Triangulate all node attributes in the scene that can be triangulated.

   Parameters:

          pScene   The scene to iterate through to triangulate meshes.
          pReplace If true, replace the original meshes with the new triangulated meshes on all the nodes, and delete the original meshes. Otherwise, original meshes are left untouched.
          pLegacy  If true, use legacy triangulation method that does not support holes in geometry. Provided for backward compatibility.

   Returns:
          true if all node attributes that can be triangulated were triangulated successfully.

   Remarks:
          The function will still iterate through all meshes regardless if one fails to triangulate, but will return false in that case. This function currently only supports node attribute of type eMesh, ePatch, eNurbs or eNurbsSurface.

                                   bool                pReplace,

   Triangulate a node attribute, if supported, and preserve the skins and shapes animation channels.

   Parameters:

          pNodeAttribute Pointer to the node containing the geometry to triangulate.
          pReplace       If true, replace the original mesh with the new triangulated mesh on the nodes, and delete the original mesh. Otherwise, original mesh is left untouched and only return new mesh.
          pLegacy        If true, use legacy triangulation method that does not support holes in geometry. Provided for backward compatibility.

   Returns:
          The newly created node attribute if successful, otherwise NULL. If node attribute type is not supported by triangulation, it returns the original node attribute.

   Remarks:
          This function currently only supports node attribute of type eMesh, ePatch, eNurbs or eNurbsSurface. If the node attribute does not support triangulation, or if it is already triangulated, this function will return pNodeAttribute.

   Parameters:

          pMesh The mesh used to generate edge smoothing.

   Returns:
          true on success, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          The edge smoothing data is placed on Layer 0 of the mesh. Normals do not need to be on Layer 0, since the first layer with per polygon vertex normals is used.

   bool ComputeEdgeSmoothingFromPolygonSmoothing ( FbxMesh *  pMesh,
                                                   int        pIndex = 0

   Search for all occurrences

   Split all the mesh in the scene per material.

   Parameters:

          pScene   The scene to iterate through to split meshes.
          pReplace If true, replace the original mesh with new ones and delete the original meshes, but *only* if they got split into multiple meshes, otherwise they are left untouched.

   Returns:
          true if all splitable mesh were successfully split, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          The function will still iterate through all meshes regardless if one fails to split, but will return false in that case.

   bool SplitMeshPerMaterial ( FbxMesh *  pMesh,
                               bool       pReplace
                             )
   Search for all occurrences

   Split mesh per material.

   Parameters:

          pMesh    The mesh that will be split if it has multiple materials assigned.
          pReplace If true, replace the original mesh with new one and delete the original mesh, but *only* if they got split into multiple meshes, otherwise left untouched.

   Returns:
          true on success, false otherwise.

   Remarks:
          The function will fail if the mapped material is not per face (FbxLayerElement::eByPolygon) or if a material is multi-layered. It will create as many meshes as there are materials applied to it. If one mesh have some polygons with material A, some polygons with material B, and some polygons with NO material, 3 meshes distinct will be created. The newly created meshes will be automatically attached to the same FbxNode that holds the original FbxMesh. If the original mesh have tangents, they
          will be regenerated on the new meshes.

   bool ResetMeshesCenterToWorld ( FbxScene *  pScene,
                                   FbxDouble   pThreshold
                                 )
   Search for all occurrences

   Reset meshes geometry center to be at world center, if delta between the two is greater than threshold.

   Basically, this function calculates the scene bounding box in world coordinates, and test if the center of that bounding box distance from the world center is larger than the threshold. If this happen to be true, this function goes ahead and substracts the center's delta to the mesh's control points directly.

   Parameters:

          pScene     The scene to iterate through meshes to reset their world center.
          pThreshold If the scene center distance from world center is greater than the threshold, apply center offset to all meshes to reset them to world center.

   Returns:
          true only if any meshes were modified, otherwise false.

   Remarks:
          This function does not work on deformed geometry.

   Merge multiple meshes to one mesh.

   The method will merge: a) mesh vertex; b) mesh polygon; c) mesh edge; d) all mesh elements; only the layer 0 elements is merged. e) if there are skins for old mesh, merge these skins. The new skin clusters link to old skeletons.

   Parameters:

          pMeshNodes FBX nodes that hold multiple meshes. These meshes will be merged.
          pNodeName  Name of new mesh node.
          pScene     The scene that will contain the new mesh node.

   Returns:
          The new mesh node if merge successfully, otherwise NULL is returned.

   Remarks:
          This method creates a new mesh, leaving the source mesh unchanged. The transform of new mesh node is: translate (0, 0, 0), rotation (0, 0, 0), scale (1, 1, 1). For layer element material, normal, smoothing, UV set, vertex color, binormal, tangent and polygon group, if any mesh misses these element, the merge for this kind of element is skipped. For layer element crease, hole, visibility and user data, if any mesh has such element, the kind of element will be merged. The missing element will
          be filled with default values. For meshes with skin binding, if the pose of frame 0 is different with bind pose, the new mesh will be distorted.
