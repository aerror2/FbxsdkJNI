Class Description

   A shape describes the deformation on a set of control points, which is similar to the cluster deformer in Maya.

   For example, we can add a shape to a created geometry. And the shape and the geometry have the same topological information but different position of the control points. With varying amounts of influence, the geometry performs a deformation effect.

   bool SetBlendShapeChannel ( FbxBlendShapeChannel *  pBlendShapeChannel )
   Search for all occurrences

   Set the blend shape channel that contains this target shape.

   Parameters:

          pBlendShapeChannel Pointer to the blend shape channel to set.

   Returns:
          true on success, false otherwise.

   FbxBlendShapeChannel* GetBlendShapeChannel ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the blend shape channel that contains this target shape.

   Returns:
          a pointer to the blend shape channel if set or NULL.

   FbxGeometry* GetBaseGeometry ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the base geometry of this target shape.

   Returns:
          a pointer to the base geometry if set or NULL.

   Remarks:
          Since target shape can only connected to its base geometry through blend shape channel and blend shape deformer. So only when this target shape is connected to a blend shape channel, and the blend shape channel is connected to a blend shape deformer, and the blend shape deformer is used on a base geometry, then to get base geometry will success.

   int GetControlPointIndicesCount ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the length of the arrays of control point indices and weights.

   Returns:
          Length of the arrays of control point indices and weights. Returns 0 if no control point indices have been added or the arrays have been reset.

   int* GetControlPointIndices ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the array of control point indices.

   Returns:
          Pointer to the array of control point indices. NULL if no control point indices have been added or the array has been reset.

   void SetControlPointIndicesCount ( int  pCount )
   Search for all occurrences

   Set the array size for the control point indices.

   Parameters:

          pCount The new count.

   void AddControlPointIndex ( int  pIndex )
   Search for all occurrences

   Add a control point index to the control point indices array.

   Parameters:

          pIndex The control point index to add.

   void Reset ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Restore the shape to its initial state.

   Calling this function will clear the following:
     * Pointer to blend shape channel.
     * Control point indices.
