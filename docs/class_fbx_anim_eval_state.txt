Class Description

   This class hold results from animation evaluations.

   To clear an evaluation state for re-use, it is possible to invalidate or to reset it. For the same scene with the same objects, invalidating an evaluation state is the quickest way to clear an evaluation state object for re-use because it only zeroes all the entries. A reset will delete all the entries. Unless the scene changes, for performance purposes it is recommended to invalidate evaluation states instead of resetting them.

Member Function Documentation

   FbxTime GetTime ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Get the time associated with this evaluation state.

   Returns:
          The time associated with this evaluation state.

   void Reset ( )
   Search for all occurrences

   Reset an evaluation state by deleting the cache it contains.

   This will remove all entries in the cache.
   void Begin ( const FbxTime &  pTime )
   Search for all occurrences

   Start a new evaluation state frame by zeroing the cache it contains, and changing its associated time.

   All node and property entries will remain in the list, but their evaluation state will not be up-to-date.

   Parameters:

          pTime The time at which the evaluation state should be set after the invalidation.

   void Flush ( FbxNode *  pNode )
   Search for all occurrences

   Invalidate a node evaluation state to force update on next evaluation.

   Parameters:

          pNode The node that needs to be updated on next evaluation.

   void Flush ( FbxProperty &  pProperty )
   Search for all occurrences

   Invalidate a property evaluation state to force update on next evaluation.

   Parameters:

          pProperty The property that needs to be updated on next evaluation.

   FbxNodeEvalState* GetNodeEvalState ( FbxNode *  pNode )
   Search for all occurrences

   Get node transform evaluation result from the evaluation state.

   Parameters:

          pNode The node for which the value was stored.

   Returns:
          The global or local matrix transform for the specified node.

   FbxPropertyEvalState* GetPropertyEvalState ( FbxProperty &  pProperty )
   Search for all occurrences

   Get a property evaluation result from the evaluation state.

   Parameters:

          pProperty The property for which the value was stored.

   Returns:
          The result value that was stored.

   FbxAnimCurveNode* GetPropertyCurveNode ( FbxProperty &   pProperty,
                                            FbxAnimLayer *  pAnimLayer
                                          )
   Search for all occurrences

   Get a property curve node from the evaluation state for quick access.

   Parameters:

          pProperty  The property to search for its animation curve node.
          pAnimLayer The animation layer on which the animation curve node must be searched.

   Remarks:
          This function uses a map to store animation curve node search results. If animation curve nodes are replaced, the evaluation state must be reset.
