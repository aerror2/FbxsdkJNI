Member Function Documentation

   FbxLibrary* GetParentLibrary ( void  ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns a pointer to the parent library if one exists.

   Reimplemented from FbxObject.
   void SystemLibrary ( bool  pSystemLibrary )
   Search for all occurrences

   Sets whether not this library is a system library.

   Parameters:

          pSystemLibrary A flag which indicates whether or not this library is a system library.

   bool IsSystemLibrary ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns whether or not this library is a system library.
   void LocalizationBaseNamePrefix ( const char *  pPrefix )
   Search for all occurrences

   The prefix must not include the dash and language code, nor can it contain the extension.

   But if you want, it can contain a folder or sub-folder, such as: locales/mydocloc. This is resolved using the XRef Manager, with priority given to the library's ".fbm" folder, if one exists.

   Parameters:

          pPrefix New prefix to be set.

   FbxString LocalizationBaseNamePrefix ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Retrieves the localization prefix.
   bool AddSubLibrary ( FbxLibrary *  pSubLibrary )
   Search for all occurrences

   Adds a sub-library.

   Parameters:

          pSubLibrary The sub-library to be added.

   Returns:
          True if adding the sub-library is successful, returns false if not.

   bool RemoveSubLibrary ( FbxLibrary *  pSubLibrary )
   Search for all occurrences

   Removes a sub-library.

   Parameters:

          pSubLibrary The sub-library to be removed.

   Returns:
          True if the sub-library is removed, false if not.

   int GetSubLibraryCount ( void  ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns the total number of sub-libraries.
   FbxLibrary* GetSubLibrary ( int  pIndex ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns the sub-library at the specified index.

   Parameters:

          pIndex The sub-library index.

   FbxObject* CloneAsset ( FbxObject *  pToClone,
                           FbxObject *  pOptionalDestinationContainer = NULL
                         )              const
   Search for all occurrences

   Clones the specified asset.

   Parameters:

          pToClone                      The asset to be cloned.
          pOptionalDestinationContainer The container for the asset copy.

   Remarks:
          The asset and all its dependents are cloned.

   static FbxCriteria GetAssetCriteriaFilter ( ) [static]
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns a criteria filter which you can use to filter objects when iterating items in the library.

   Only real 'assets' are returned, rather than FBX support objects. This currently includes lights, environments, materials and textures (maps). This is typically used to IMPORT from a library.
   static FbxCriteria GetAssetDependentsFilter ( ) [static]
   Search for all occurrences

   Returns a filter which you should use when you clone / export objects.

   This filters out objects that should remain in the asset library.

   Use this to EXPORT from a library (or CLONE from a library).
   bool ImportAssets ( FbxLibrary *  pSrcLibrary )
   Search for all occurrences

   Transfers ownership from the source library to this library for any assets passing through the filter.

   It is assumed that name conflicts and other details have been resolved beforehand.

   External asset files required by the assets are copied (not moved). It's up to the owner of the source library to clean up the files if the files are not on a read-only transport. If this document hasn't been committed yet, the assets will not be copied.

   Returns true if no filtered assets were skipped. If no assets pass through the filter, it returns true, because nothing has been skipped.

   This may leave the source library in an invalid state. For example, the source library would be in an invalid state if you had decided to transfer texture objects to the library, but materials were kept in the source library.

   To safeguard against this, the transfer disconnects objects, and thus materials are left without textures.

   When you transfer an object, all its dependents come with it. If you move a material, it takes the associated textures as well. Although if you moved a texture, the material would not be transferred with it.

   Parameters:

          pSrcLibrary The source library to be imported.

   Returns:
          True if no filtered assets are skipped.

   bool ImportAssets ( FbxLibrary *         pSrcLibrary,
                       const FbxCriteria &  pAssetFilter
                     )
   Search for all occurrences

                        )
   Search for all occurrences

   This instantiates the first object found that matches the filter.

   Parameters:

          pFBX_TYPE     The type of member
          pFilter       A user specified filter

   FbxLocalizationManager& GetLocalizationManager ( ) const
   Search for all occurrences

   virtual const char* Localize ( const char *  pID,
                                  const char *  pDefault = NULL
