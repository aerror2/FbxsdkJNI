Class Description

   The base class to inherit from when creating new plug-ins for the FBX SDK.

   Plug-ins for the FBX SDK are extremely flexible allowing a wide-range of possibilities. For example, one can write his own plug-in to add new readers/writers to the current list of supported I/O formats, or add new dynamic classes to instantiate custom objects that can later be stored in FBX files. We also use the same interface for plug-ins written using the FBX Extension SDK, which allow additional callbacks for other various Autodesk products enabling greater interoperability with multiple
   various SDKs.

   Here is typical implementation of an FBX SDK plug-in that doesn't do anything else than just registering itself:
 class MyPlugin : public FbxPlugin
 {
     FBXSDK_PLUGIN_DECLARE(MyPlugin); //This macro is mandatory for any plug-in definition

 protected:
     explicit MyPlugin(const FbxPluginDef& pDefinition, FbxModule pModuleHandle) : FbxPlugin(pDefinition, pModuleHandle)
     {
     }

     //Abstract functions that *must* be implemented
     virtual bool SpecificInitialize()
     {
         //For example, here we could register as many new I/O readers/writers as we would like, or classes, etc.
         return true;
     }

     virtual bool SpecificTerminate()
     {
         //Here we would have to unregister whatever we registered to the FBX SDK
         return true;
     }
 };

 FBXSDK_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT(MyPlugin); //This macro is mandatory for any plug-in implementation

 //Standard C export needed for any new FBX SDK plug-in
 extern "C"
 {
     static MyPlugin* sMyPluginInstance = NULL; //The module is owner of the plug-in

     //This function will be called when an application will request the plug-in
 #ifdef FBXSDK_ENV_WIN
     __declspec(dllexport) void FBXPluginRegistration(FbxPluginContainer& pContainer, FbxModule pModuleHandle)
 #else
     void FBXPluginRegistration(FbxPluginContainer& pContainer, FbxModule pModuleHandle)
 #endif
     {
         if( sPlugin == NULL )
         {
             //Create the plug-in definition which contains the information about the plug-in
             FbxPluginDef sPluginDef;
             sPluginDef.mName = "My Plugin";
             sPluginDef.mVersion = "1.0";

             //Create an instance of the plug-in
             sMyPluginInstance = MyPlugin::Create(sPluginDef, pLibHandle);

             //Register the plug-in with the FBX SDK
             pContainer.Register(*sPlugin);
         }
     }
 }

   FbxPlugin ( const FbxPluginDef &  pDefinition,
               FbxModule             pModuleHandle
             )                       [explicit, protected]

   Use the Create() and Destroy() methods declared and implemented in the FBXSDK_PLUGIN_DECLARE and FBXSDK_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT macros to construct and destroy FbxPlugin objects.

   Parameters:

          pDefinition   The definition associated with this plug-in. Each plug-in must have its own definition to differentiate it with other plug-ins.
          pModuleHandle A pointer to the plug-in module address.

   Abstract function called once at the end of the plug-in construction.

   At that moment, plug-in data have been properly initialized. This function must be implemented by anyone who writes a new plug-in for the FBX SDK.
   virtual bool SpecificTerminate ( ) [pure virtual]
   Search for all occurrences

   Abstract function called once at the beginning of the plug-in destruction.

   At that moment, plug-in data is fully available. This function must be implemented by anyone who writes a new plug-in for the FBX SDK.
   virtual void WriteBegin ( FbxScene &  pScene ) [virtual]
   Search for all occurrences

   Virtual function called once when the FBX SDK is about to write an FBX file.

   Users can re-implement it in their plug-in if they need to perform tasks at that moment. The scene provided in parameter can be altered. If not re-implemented, this function does nothing.

   Parameters:

   Search for all occurrences

   Virtual function called once when the FBX SDK is about to write plug-in's parameters.

   Users can re-implement it in their plug-in if they need to store properties in the FBX file for their own usage. The object in parameter is used to store those properties. If not re-implemented, this function does nothing.

   Parameters:

          pParams An abstract object that can be used as a property container, to allow the plug-in to store properties about the plug-in.

   virtual void WriteEnd ( FbxScene &  pScene ) [virtual]
   Search for all occurrences

   Virtual function called once after the FBX SDK wrote an FBX file.

   Users can re-implement it in their plug-in if they need to perform tasks at that moment. The scene provided in parameter can be altered, but the changes will not appear in the FBX file. If not re-implemented, this function does nothing.

   Parameters:
