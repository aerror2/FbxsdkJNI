Class Description

   Class for clusters (links).

   A cluster, or link, is an entity acting on a geometry (FbxGeometry). More precisely, the cluster acts on a subset of the geometry's control points. For each control point that the cluster acts on, the intensity of the cluster's action is modulated by a weight. The link mode (ELinkMode) specifies how the weights are taken into account.

   The cluster's link node specifies the node (FbxNode) that influences the control points of the cluster. If the node is animated, the control points will move accordingly.

   A cluster is usually part of a skin (

   See also:
          FbxDeformer, FbxSkin). For example, imagine a mesh representing a humanoid, and imagine a skeleton made of bones. Each bone is represented by a node in FBX. To bind the geometry to the nodes, we create a skin (FbxSkin). The skin has many clusters, each one corresponding to a bone. Each node influences some control points of the mesh. A node has a high influence on some of the points (high weight) and lower influence on some other points (low weight). Some points of the mesh are not affected
          at all by the bone, so they would not be part of the corresponding cluster.

   Examples:
          ExportScene01/main.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayLink.cxx, SwitchBinding/main.cxx, and ViewScene/DrawScene.cxx.

Control Points

   A link has an array of indices to control points and associated weights.

   The indices refer to the control points in the instance of class FbxGeometry owning the link. The weights are the influence of the link node over the displacement of the indexed control points.
              void  AddControlPointIndex (int pIndex, double pWeight)
                    Add an element in both arrays of control point indices and weights.

          double *  GetControlPointWeights () const
                    Get the array of control point weights.

Transformation matrices

   A link has three transformation matrices:
     * Transform refers to the global initial transform of the geometry node that contains the link node.
     * TransformLink refers to global initial transform of the link node.
     * TransformAssociateModel refers to the global initial transform of the associate model.

   For example, given a mesh binding with several bones(links), Transform is the global transform of the mesh at the binding moment, TransformLink is the global transform of the bone(link) at the binding moment, TransformAssociateModel is the global transform of the associate model at the binding moment.
              void  SetTransformMatrix (const FbxAMatrix &pMatrix)

   Link modes.

   The link mode sets how the link influences the position of a control point and the relationship between the weights assigned to a control point. The weights assigned to a control point are distributed among the set of links associated with an instance of class FbxGeometry.

   Enumerator:

   eNormalize

   In mode eNormalize, the sum of the weights assigned to a control point is normalized to 1.0.
   Setting the associate model in this mode is not relevant. The influence of the link is a function of the displacement of the link node relative to the node containing the control points.
   Search for all occurrences
   eAdditive

   In mode eAdditive, the sum of the weights assigned to a control point is kept as is.
   It is the only mode where setting the associate model is relevant. The influence of the link is a function of the displacement of the link node relative to the node containing the control points or, if set, the associate model. The weight gives the proportional displacement of a control point. For example, if the weight of a link over a control point is set to 2.0, a displacement of the link node of 1 unit in the X direction relative to the node containing the control points or, if set, the
   associate model, triggers a displacement of the control point of 2 units in the same direction.

          eTotalOne

   Mode eTotalOne is identical to mode eNormalize except that the sum of the weights assigned to a control point is not normalized and must equal 1.0.
