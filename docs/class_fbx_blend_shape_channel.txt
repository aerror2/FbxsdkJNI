Class Description

   Class for blend shape channels.

   A blend shape channel is a sub-deformer to help blend shape deformer to organize the target shapes. One blend shape deformer can have multiple blend shape channels in parallel, and each of them can control one or multiple target shapes. If there are multiple target shapes connected to one channel, each target shape could have its own full deformation percentage. For example, given a channel that has 3 target shapes, whose full deform percentage are 30, to 80 to 100 separately, then when the percent
   changes from 0 to 100, the base geometry will deform from the first target shape to the last one. This is called in-between blend shapes or progressive morph. The property DeformPercent of blend shape channel will control the deform level of each target shape or in-between blend shape on it.

   Examples:
          ExportScene02/main.cxx, ExportScene03/main.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayAnimation.cxx, ImportScene/DisplayShape.cxx, and ViewScene/DrawScene.cxx.

Member Data Documentation

   FbxPropertyT<FbxDouble> DeformPercent
   Search for all occurrences

   This property stores deform percent of this channel.

   The default value of this property is 0.0.

   Remarks:
          Although not enforced, it is strongly suggested to limit the value of this property in the range from 0.0 to 100.0 because graphic applications may handle values outside of this interval differently, therefore producing unexpected results.

   Examples:
          ImportScene/DisplayShape.cxx.
